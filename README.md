#Anna's and Kalina's Lab 3 Project
It´s the third assignment for the Informatics 3 course with Barbara Kleinen.
We are supposed to learn how to use git, what branches are, how to commit something, and so on.
Whilst we go along we will add some notes to our central repository. Our notes will be some recipes in german as it
really doesn´t matter what the notes are about.
